    <p>This is a program hosted by Chongqing Education Bureau. My teammates and I took classes from college professors and made a project that aims for a smartly auto-following shopping cart in the mall by integrating UWB technology and C++ programming tool. However, along the course, due to COVID-19 and increasingly hard access to advanced microchips, the UWB technology was impractical in our project. Therefore, we dopted infrared to be the substitute. Finally, we built up a prototype (smaller-scaled) cart to demonstrate our idea. The cart could seld-move according to the gestures of a person in front, as can be shown in the video below.
