									<p>We went to <strong>Yunnan</strong>, Southwestern part of China, to test the efficacy of our water purifier. It's worth mentioning, though, that beforehand we also went to other viliages to do the same thing in order to increase our sample size for statistical use.</p>

										<p><strong>We found that, after using our product, the water sampled from the stream nearby the farm had improved in various measurement factor. The picture is a glance at it. Since we presented our product to the public in China--mostly people far away from city--, our results were in Chinese. The x-axis denotes viliages' names we visited, y-axis denotes filter rate, and the white bar denotes ordinary water purifier with activated carbon filter while the blue bar denotes our product with sphagnum being the filter.</strong></p>
